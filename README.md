# Adult-Income
Data Analysis Project in Python using Adult Income dataset

In this project, I'll be using the "Adult Income" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains information about individuals' demographics, education, and income, and our goal will be to use this data to predict whether an individual makes over $50,000 per year.

After finishing our analysis as showed in the python file, We can get the insights as following:

1- Income is positively associated with education level, work experience, and work hours per week. Individuals with higher education levels, more work experience, and longer work hours tend to make more money. 
2- Males are more likely to make over 50,000 per year compared to female, and individuals are married with a spouse present are more likely to make over 50,000 per year compared to other marital status categories.
3- There are some occupations, such as "Exec-managerial", "Prof-specialty" and "Sales", that have a higher proportion of individuals making over $50,000 per year compared to other occupations.
